# Academic Paper Formatting tips

For now, on this course we're not going to take care of the 
format, we just need content: for now, I repeat. But by the end of 
the quarter, you need to format a document. Therefore,
you need to have this in the back of your mind. 

  ## Introduction

  Proper formatting is essential in academic writing, as it ensures
  clarity, consistency, and adherence to institutional or publication
  standards. This guide provides tips on formatting academic papers
  effectively, covering elements such as font, spacing, margins, headings,
  and citation styles. Of course, this is standard, but it can range from
  reading device to reading device. It is completely different to read 
  from a book, than to read from a screen. 

  Take for example the main motivation of Donald Knuth in the 
  development of TeX. Donald wanted to see it printed in paper. 
  He even went so far as to design a [new font for his book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern)
  The academia became fixated by the LaTeX typesetting system, a
  system --LaTeX,-- that was designed to make TeX available to a wider 
  audience.

  But now, we seldom use printed media to gain information.
  We use the screens of cellphones, computers and tablets. We even
  have devices like the Amazon Kindle and the Kobo Reader, devices 
  that are trying to mix and have the best of both worlds.
  I personally have a Kindle. And I love to use it, but the format
  that I want for my Kindle is totally different from the format I
  want my book to be. 
  
  

   ## Font and Font Size

   Use a standard, readable font like Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri.
   Typically, the font size should be 12-point for the main text. For
   headers and footnotes, a slightly smaller font size (10-point) is often
   acceptable.

   ## Spacing

   Double-space the entire document, including the title page, abstract,
   body, and references. Avoid extra spacing between paragraphs or sections
   unless specified by guidelines.

   ## Margins

   Set 1-inch margins on all sides of the page. Consistent margins give the
   paper a clean and professional look, ensuring that it meets academic
   standards.

   ## Page Numbers

   Insert page numbers in the upper right-hand corner of each page,
   starting with the title page if required. Use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3,
   etc.).

   ## Title Page

   Include a title page with the paper\'s title, your name, institution,
   course name, instructor\'s name, and the submission date. Center the
   information, and follow specific formatting guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA)
   for exact details.

   ## Headings and Subheadings

   Use headings and subheadings to organize the paper\'s content. In APA
   style, there are five levels of headings, each with specific formatting.
   Ensure that headings are clear, concise, and relevant to the content
   that follows.
    
   ## In-text Citations
  
   Use in-text citations to give credit to sources within the text. Follow
   the citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) specified by your
   instructor or institution. Ensure accuracy in author names, publication
   years, and page numbers.

   ## Reference List

   Include a reference list or bibliography at the end of the paper,
   listing all sources cited in the text. Format this section according to
   the required citation style, and use a hanging indent for each entry.

   ## Figures and Tables

   Label all figures and tables clearly, providing a brief, descriptive
   title. Place each figure or table close to where it is mentioned in the
   text, and refer to them by their respective numbers (e.g., \'Table 1\',
   \'Figure 2\').

   ## Proofreading

   Before submitting, thoroughly proofread your paper for grammar,
   spelling, and formatting errors. Ensure that all elements adhere to the
   formatting guidelines and that the paper is consistent in style and
   structure.
