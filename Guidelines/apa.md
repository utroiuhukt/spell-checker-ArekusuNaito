# APA Referencing Guidelines

## Introduction to APA Referencing

The American Psychological Association (APA) style is a widely used
referencing format in academic writing, particularly in the social
sciences. This guide provides an overview of APA referencing guidelines,
including in-text citations, reference list formatting, and examples for
various source types.

## In-text Citations

In APA style, in-text citations are used to give credit to sources
within the body of the text. Each in-text citation should include the
author's last name and the publication year. For direct quotes, also
include the page number.

### Examples:

• Paraphrasing: (Author, Year)\
Example: (Smith, 2020)

• Direct Quote: (Author, Year, p. Page Number)\
Example: (Smith, 2020, p. 15)

If the author's name is already mentioned in the text, include only the
year in parentheses after the author's name. For example: According to
Smith (2020), ...

## Reference List

The reference list provides full details of each source cited in the
text. Start the reference list on a new page with the title
\'References\' centered at the top. List entries alphabetically by the
author's last name, and use a hanging indent for each entry.
